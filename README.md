# FytOrbital

## Purpose

Terminal based game. This game is to help me build and understand how to use
Java. My goal is to use interfaces and design patterns to develope this game.

## Build Project

To build the project first clean the project. Their should not be any target
information but to be safe.
```sh
maven clean
```

Then to begin the build use the following command.
```sh
maven compile
```

After it compiles then we package it into a jar file.
```sh
maven jar:jar
```
